### dependencies 

[lowdown.](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/)

### usage

to replicate this, you'd need 2 html files (\_header.html, \_footer.html and optionally \_404.html) and your articles in markdown.

after that you execute `ssg5 $src-folder $dst-folder 'website name' 'websitelink.com'`\*, in the `$dst-folder` you'll find your generated html files that are ready to be deployed!
*\*check my [.aliasrc](https://github.com/hamidout/website/blob/main/.aliasrc) file for more clarity*

### to-do

\*you still have to write down the timestamp for your article in md, if you figured out a way to make it automatic feel free to open a PR.
