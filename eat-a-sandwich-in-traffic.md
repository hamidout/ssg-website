in the past couple of days, rain came down hard on the city where i live, which is unusual. it is often sunny in here, and the rain doesn't last this long. (rip to the people who depend on solar energy for their hot water ðŸ¤¦).

since this is a "developing" country we're talking about, the road infrastracture isn't ready for these kinds of showers... meaning *holes* in the roads, ***big giant*** holes.

anyway, i was out to buy some headphones (which i ended up not doing) and noticed the traffic jam on the opposite road. on my way back i got hungry so i ordered myself fries and a chicken breast sandwich with lettuce (i love lettuce!) as takeout. it turned out to be such a good decision because traffic was slow due to the road holes. nobody wants to damage their cars driving into them, of course.

stick shift in first gear, feet slowly moving and stopping the car, it's fresh chicken sandwich and fries timeee (i don't like using the term french fries for some reason idk, i don't like tomatoes too ðŸ¤®, i don't like a lot of things, maybe even you). the sandwich tasted good!

by the time i finished it, the traffic jam had cleared out and i went home.

how was **your** day? [email me](mailto:hamid@hamidout.xyz).
