# why did i make this website?

![old Internet](pix/old-internet.png =600x)

a couple of years ago, like *almost* every other internet user, i had a facebook account where i used to share what's going on inside my mind with the virtual world. it was *kinda* nice.

**but** as the years passed, the platform, and by extent the whole internet turned to shit, cringe, an annoyance and a million other things but 'nice'.

other social media websites are no different, and almost all of them are owned by the same companies that suck out your private information and fill your computer with ads and junk.

i've since [deleted my facebook account](https://m.facebook.com/account/delete) and you should too. ᵗʳᵘˢᵗ ᵐᵉ.

i still use the internet (duh) and have a lot of stuff I'd love to share with the virtual world, be it ideas, computer tutorials or just random thoughts. all without using any of the privacy-breaching ad-filled censoring "social media" platforms. That's why i decided to create this little space where i can hangout and let it all out.

i guess this is what the old internet originally looked like before the zuck curse hit the internet.

hope you'll find something interesting around here. See you in a future post. 👊
